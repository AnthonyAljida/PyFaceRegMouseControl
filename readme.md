# Installation

Python 3.11 was used for this project

```bash
pip install pyautogui opencv-python dlib SpeechRecognition
```

If dlib gives you issues, and you are using conda, use this command `conda install -c conda-forge dlib` otherwise, you will need to watch a youtube video for pip installing dlib or text in discord, this line after discussion can be removed
